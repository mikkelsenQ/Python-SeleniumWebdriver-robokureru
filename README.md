# robokureru
Python program for automating entering GAs in the steamgifts website.

# Requirements

None other than Python. This python program runs with Linux (tested with Debian) but should run under any OS. 

If you're running it with OSX or windows, comment out the "import subprocess" "subprocess.check_output("play " + soundsystem, shell=True)" lines in 'mqgift.py'.

Please contact me if you test it with Windows or OSX. Feedback is appreciated.
